Biased adaptation on <a href="https://github.com/jcjohnson/densecap" alt="Densecap">Densecap</a>
Javascript is added to the html result page.

Replace the view_results.html in the /vis folder of the original densecap with political_densecap.html and the captions will be a lot more fun. Also replace the stylesheet.
Developed for an Art project. link soon.
